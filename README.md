# Finstagram

This is a course project for CS-UY 3083, Introduction to Database Systems, completed on my own.

Finstagram a web application for sharing photos. It gives users more privacy than many photo sharing sites by giving them more detailed control over who can see which photos they post. The focus of the project will be on storing data about who posted which photos and who has permission to view them, tag others
in them, see whoâ€™s tagged in what, etc. Users will be able to log in, post photos, view (some of) the content items posted by others (public photos, photos posted by people they are `following`, and close friends);`tag` photos items with handles of people, etc. The project is realized with Python, MySQL, Flask and HTML.

Process: Design ER diagram --> create table --> implement application code for Finstagram as a web-based application.
